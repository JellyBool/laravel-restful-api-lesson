Thanks for contributing to this project.


**Please submit your pull request against the `develop` branch only.**


Please ensure that you run `phpunit` from the project root after you've made any changes.

If you've added something new please create a new unit test, if you've changed something please update any unit tests as appropritate.

We're trying to ensure there is **100%** test code coverage (including testing PHP errors and exceptions) so please ensure any new/updated tests cover all of your changes.

Thank you,
